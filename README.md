# Developer portfolio site for @frye

## Description
This is a pretty simple portfolio website created from screatch. Its purpose is to highlight my development work down the road, 
when I have more completed applications to showcase. For now it is filled with mostly placeholder content. 

The site has been built with HTML, CSS and very basic Javascript and is designed to be responsive and usable with various screen sizes.

## Screenshots
Below GIF shows the basic functionality and the layout of the page.
